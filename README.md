# TypeScript Analyzer (tsa)
This is the analysis tool used by the [sonar-typescript-plugin](https://github.com/sandermvanvliet/sonar-typescript-plugin). 
It uses the TypeScript library to parse files and provide metrics on code.

## Suggestions and contributions
I'm open to pull requests and suggestions. If you feel something is missing, please let me know and open a new issue. If you just want to say hi that's fine too ;-)
